    "- <strong>Catalog:</strong> contains information about existing tables and, based on the table(s) you want to retrieve, to which metadata files point at.\n",
    "- <strong>Metadata file:</strong> stores data about table schema, partitioning schema and historical snapshots. A snapshot represents the state of a table at a certain point in time (time travel feature). \n",
    "- <strong>Manifest list snapshot:</strong> determine the list of manifest files that client can query based on the stapshot desired.\n",
    "- <strong>Manifest file list:</strong> contains informations about which data files point at, based on the snapshot client wants to retrieve. Note that one or more manifest file can compose the snapshot of the table.\n",
    "- <strong>Data files:</strong> contains data which are stored as default option in parquet files (lossless compressed).\n",
    "- <strong>Delete files:</strong> There are also delete files. Delete files encode rows of a table that are deleted in existing data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time a table is modified, a snapshot is created and the connected components are updated. The created manifest file contains only the changes applied to the table, meaning: it does not rewrite the whole file.\n",
    "Note also that all this metadata enable performance optimizations (e.g. by pointing only at the relevant data files without having to scan them all).\n"
