    "- <strong>Manifest list snapshot:</strong> determine the list of manifest files that client can query based on the stapshot desired.\n",
    "- <strong>Manifest file list:</strong> contains informations about which data files point at, based on the snapshot client wants to retrieve. Note that one or more manifest file can compose the snapshot of the table.\n",
